# Predicting-House-Prices

This work uses linear regression to predict house prices and includes key operations related to data preprocessing. Beginning with data cleaning, the algorithm discards a set of columns where the ratio of the missing values dominates, and rescales and then encodes the factors to be as an input for the model. Mean squared error is used to assess the model and its accuracy is demonstrated to determine its reliability. Several of these steps include feature engineering, handling missing value systematically, which denotes that this is reasonable for real estate price forecasting.
